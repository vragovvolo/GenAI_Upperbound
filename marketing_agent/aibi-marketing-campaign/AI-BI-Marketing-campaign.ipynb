    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on their industry, organizations often spend anywhere from **7% to 25%** of their overall revenue collectively on marketing campaigns. While crucial to the business, organizations without a strong data intelligence platform struggle to unify siloed data, translate campaign outcomes to leadership, and experience tremendous slowdowns in time-to-analytics after a campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks' Intelligence Platform leverages **AI and Business Intelligence (_or as we call it, AI/BI_)** to democratize access to your organization's data. By integrating data from various marketing channels into a unified, cohesive environment, Databricks breaks down silos and makes comprehensive insights available to all team members. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced AI-driven analytics and intuitive BI tools empower both technical and non-technical users to effortlessly analyze campaign performance by asking questions of their data platform in natural language. This accessibility accelerates time-to-insights, enhances collaboration across departments, and enables leadership to make informed, data-driven decisions that optimize marketing strategies and drive business growth.\n",

    "2. Data Governance and Security with **Unity Catalog**\n",
    "3. Creating Beautiful **Dashboards** with Databricks\n",
